CAESAR CIPHER PYTHON TOOL

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and earliest known encryption techniques. It's named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to encrypt his private correspondence.

1 --> Encryption Process:

  The encryption involves shifting each letter of the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.
  For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' would be replaced by 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on.
  If the end of the alphabet is reached, the shift wraps around to the beginning.

2 --> Decryption Process:

  Decryption involves shifting each letter of the ciphertext in the opposite direction by the same number of positions.
  For example, with a shift of 3, 'D' would be replaced by 'A', 'E' would become 'B', and so on.
  Like encryption, decryption wraps around to the end or beginning of the alphabet as needed.
